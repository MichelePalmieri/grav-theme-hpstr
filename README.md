# HPSTR Grav Theme

This [Grav](http://getgrav.org) theme is a port of the [Jekyll HPSTR Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme) developed my [mmistakes](https://mademistakes.com/). 

This started off as a bit of an experiment to see how much time and effort it would take to port a **Jekyll** theme to **Grav**.  Also I wanted to ensure that Grav had all the features and capabilities to pull this off.  It took me 1 full day to complete from start to finish and is 100% feature complete with the original Jekyll version.  I have taken the liberty to modify the file structure to better suite Grav's organization paradigm.

## Installation / Configuration

The theme by itself is not that useful, so please check out the [HPSTR Skeleton Package](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-skeleton-hpstr-site) that is the self-contained repository for a complete HPSTR site which includes: **sample content**, **configuration**, **theme**, **plugins**.
